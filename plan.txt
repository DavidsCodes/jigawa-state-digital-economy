Excerpt from Inaugural Speech of His Excellency, ( Malam Umar A. Namadi FCA )
Executive Governor of Jigawa State





Preface 
We are standing on the threshold of a new era, wherein the digital revolution is reshaping the world and transforming the way we
live, work, and conduct business. As Jigawa State embraces this era of rapid technological advancements, we recognize the
immense potential of the digital economy to drive inclusive growth, foster innovation, and empower the people of our state. The
Jigawa State Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (JDEPS) serves as a roadmap to harness the power of the digital economy and
unleash its transformative impact on our state. This policy is a testament to our commitment to creating an enabling
environment that nurtures digital innovation, attracts investments, and unlocks new opportunities for our citizens. In developing
this policy draft, we have engaged in consultations with experts, stakeholders, and industry leaders to gain valuable insights and
best practices. We have listened to the aspirations of our people and understood their needs, ensuring that this policy is rooted
in the realities and aspirations of Jigawa State. The digital economy policy outlines a comprehensive strategy that encompasses
various dimensions of the digital economy, ranging from digital infrastructure and connectivity to digital skills development,
entrepreneurship, and digital governance. It takes into account the unique strengths and challenges of our state, leveraging our
rich cultural heritage, entrepreneurial spirit, and technological advancement.


This policy draft emphasizes the importance of collaboration and partnerships. We acknowledge that the digital economy is not
built by the government alone but requires the active participation of academia, the private sector, civil society, and our citizens.
By fostering collaboration and leveraging collective expertise, resources, and ideas, we can accelerate digital transformation.
Furthermore, inclusivity lies at the heart of developing this digital economy policy and strategy. Jigawa State is committed to
bridging the digital divide, ensuring that every citizen, regardless of their background or location, has access to affordable and
reliable digital infrastructure. We prioritize digital skills development, particularly among underserved communities, to empower
people with the knowledge and tools to fully participate in the digital economy. As Jigawa State embarks on this journey towards
a thriving digital economy, we are aware of the challenges and risks that lie ahead.


We recognize the need for a robust regulatory framework that safeguards privacy, protects intellectual property rights, and
ensures cybersecurity. We are committed to addressing these challenges head-on by adapting our policies and regulations to
the evolving digital landscape. The Jigawa State Digital Economy Policy and Strategy is not just a document; it is a commitment
to our people, a call to action for all stakeholders, and a roadmap to a brighter future. We invite all citizens, businesses, and
institutions to join us on this transformative journey as we build a prosperous, inclusive, and digitally empowered Jigawa State.
Together, let us embrace the digital revolution and create a future where innovation flourishes, entrepreneurship thrives, and our
people reap the full benefits of the digital economy.



Pillar 1 (Developmental Regulation)
Developmental Regulation has to do with the government's social, economic, and environmental policy objectives. To
develop a thriving digital economy, it is necessary to implement the appropriate regulatory instruments. Currently, there
are no dedicated MDAs responsible for the digital economy in Jigawa state as such, MDAs implement ICT projects in
silos.


Furthermore, there is bureaucracy and a slow legislative/governance process to approving policies and the awareness
level of the existing regulations with regards to the digital economy is low amongst key players and stakeholders.
However, the state has developed an E-government master plan and strategy document governing the digital
economy in the State.



Jigawa State developed strategic frameworks and action plans to promote a sustainable and socio-economically
developed state through exemplary and transparent leadership, provision of social service through strong and
functional institutions, and the development of physical infrastructure based on broad participation by the people
(Planning, 2016). The State also developed a framework for an e-government masterplan to have an efficient and
innovative public service and digitally empowered citizens and businesses that leverage the State’s comparative
advantages and the global digital economy opportunities for social, economic, and sustainable development. Galaxy

Pillars objectives 

- To review and upgrade ICT-related existing laws and policies such as e-procurement, e-finance, digitization of revenue collection (e-tax), e-certificate in land registry, etc.
- To make a law that will regulate all ICT activities in the State.
- To Secure formal approval of the e-governance master plan for implementation
- To establish a full-pledged ICT Agency in the State



Pillar 2 (Digital Literacy and Skills)

Situation Analysis
A digital economy can only be as robust as its citizens' level of digital literacy. Literacy today encompasses more than
the capacity to read and write. A person who is literate in the fourth industrial revolution must be digitally literate. As the
significance of digital technology to society increases, so does the value of digital literacy as an instrument for lifelong
education. In terms of government initiatives about digital literacy and skills in Jigawa state, the state has a policy on
digital literacy in its education bill, through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology

Jigawa State has been one of the early movers to drive digital literacy in Nigeria since 2000 when it launched the
Jigawa State Institute of Informatics and International ICT Scholarship (State Ministry of Education) to provide digital
technology skills to its youthful population. This institute has trained over 5000 youths amidst low digital literacy
inclusion and deepening, as about 50% of Jigawa state citizens are rural dwellers who do not have network coverage
and thus find it almost impossible to access the digital literacy initiatives.

Pillars Objectives

- To integrate digital literacy and skills into the state educational curriculum at all levels.
- To support training and capacity building among public sector employees.
- To create a pool of Jigawa state citizens with digital skills.
- To bridge the gap between academia and industry.
- To minimize access barriers to digital tools for Jigawa citizens.



Pillar 3 ( Solid Infrastructure ) 

Situation analysis
The solid infrastructure pillar will address the deployment of fixed and mobile infrastructure to increase the state’s
broadband penetration. Without nationwide access to high-speed Internet, an inclusive and thriving digital economy
will be difficult to achieve. Currently, in Jigawa state there are no policies guiding broadband access, data center, and
spectrum frequency management. There’s a low level of awareness of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP)
including the Right of Way (RoW) policy. Ironically, the Jigawa State House of Assembly does not have a committee on
ICT/Digital Transformation.

The data center in the State Secretariat is the offshoot of the project called State and Local Government (SLOGO) which
started in 2016. SLOGO also has a component called State Integrated Financial Management Information System
(SIFMIS). It was financed by the European Union (EU) through the World Bank. Previously, Jigawa State used Integrated
Financial Management. Jigawa State also took the giant stride to set



Pillar Objectives 
- To identify and fill existing gaps of the required ICT physical infrastructure.
- To accelerate the penetration of affordable and quality broadband internet in the state.
- Support proliferation of data centers across the state.


Pillar 4 ( Service Infrastructure ) 

The service infrastructure pillar will address the provision of dependable digital platforms to propel the digital economy.
These platforms facilitate online transactions and interactions. In addition, they enable a supply of data from which the
government and private sector can obtain useful insights for the development of the digital economy. Currently, Jigawa
State has the State Integrated Financial Management Information System (SIFMIS) which is the information system
used by the Jigawa State Government for recording, accounting, and reporting on its overall fiscal operations. The state
also has a Payroll system, Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS), and Jigawa State Government E-Procurement.
This pillar supports the provision of a centralized online platform for the government to communicate with
citizens and investors. It facilitates the implementation of digital government services and a paperless system. Without
digital platforms to access services, the objective of developing a digital economy will remain unattainable.

Pillar Objectives 

- Approval and implementation of the E-government Master Plan, including the State e-government Interoperability Framework (SeGIF) and Enterprise Architecture.
- Promotion and adoption of digital platforms.
- Use of digital platforms for the extraction and warehousing of anonymized big data for the public good.
- Promote the creation and use of digital platforms in government and non-government sectors.

Pillar 5 (Digital Service Development and Promotion )

Situation Analysis 

The digital services development and promotion pillar will focus on the creation of an innovative digital ecosystem that
supports Innovative Driven Enterprises (IDEs) and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Currently, Jigawa state
does not have any policy, framework, or guidelines supporting technology Startups or Services. There is a need to
support the existing training centers in terms of training and to upgrade their capability to innovation hubs. There is little
or no discussion about the startup bill or awareness about it among stakeholders. Furthermore, there’s a need for
innovation hubs that can build the capacity of both government employees and citizens.



Pillar Objectives 
- Support for the creation of innovation-driven enterprises and digitally enabled SMEs.
- Facilitation of mentorship and funding programmes to support innovation driven enterprises and digitally enabled MSMEs.
- Enabling innovation driven enterprises and digitally enabled MSMEs.
- Facilitate the launch of Digital Innovation and Scale-up Centers (DISC), IT and innovation hubs.
- Facilitate PPP synergy to promote digital services in the State.



Pillar 6 ( Soft Infrastructure )

Situation Analysis
The soft infrastructure pillar aims to increase public trust in the use of digital technologies and participation in the
digital economy. It emphasizes the significance of cybersecurity and other standards, frameworks, and guidelines that
encourage citizens to adopt digital technologies. This pillar addresses data privacy and the deployment of technologies
such as the public key infrastructure. Currently, there is no harmonized existing law or policy governing the digital
economy in Jigawa state. Thus, much work is needed to be done in this pillar to achieve a robust digital economy in
Jigawa state.


Pillars Objectives
- Review and Strengthen Cyber Security Instruments to ensure that Citizens are Secured.
- Strengthening Data protection Instrument.
- Support Digital for Data Implementation Programme.


Pillar 7 (Digital Society and Emerging Technologies )


Situation Analysis
The digital society and emerging technologies concentrate on tying the growth of the digital economy to measures of
the well-being of average citizens. The objectives of this pillar include addressing digital inclusion and financial
inclusion. Currently, there are no robust provisions for PWDs in the digital economy draft plan and policy of the state.
Furthermore, there is no strategy for women's inclusion in tech.


Thus, there is much work needed to be done in this pillar to achieve a robust digital economy in Jigawa state. Currently,
the private sector in the state has taken the initiative to drive the digital society through programs such as Start-up
Jigawa, and Next Jigawa. “Next Jigawa” is a platform driving agenda settings for digital policy. Next Jigawa involves
CSOs, state and non-state actors, business membership organizations, people with disabilities (PWDs), academics,
women, etc. to develop the policy of the citizen’s charter which is shared, reviewed, modified, and used to drive digital
inclusion of women in the state and Engausa Digital Literacy program in Ringim, etc.


Pillar Objectives 
Digital Inclusion across gender, disability, and social strata
Financial Inclusion through the use of fintech solutions.
Establishment of Emerging Technology Centers


Pillars 8 (Indigenous Content Development and Adoption )


Situation Analysis

The indigenous content development and adoption pillar will provide a policy direction for promoting local digital
innovations vis-à-vis digital service opportunities through the adoption and adaptation of digital technologies
propelled and driven by indigenous digital talents in the State. It will identify jobs that are presently being outsourced
and promote their repatriation to Jigawa citizens with digital skills. Currently, there are no laws or regulations about
indigenous content development in Jigawa State. Indigenous talents and service providers are not being patronized
enough. The state government needs to give more opportunities to its indigenes because of the pool of talent that
exists. By promoting and implementing indigenous content, Jigawa state will be able to profit from the globalization of
the digital technology market. It will also help the state save foreign currency and increase exports. The activities in this
pillar will ensure that the grade of "Made in Jigawa" digital economy products meets international standards.
Additionally, this pillar will aim to make Jigawa state a global outsourcing destination for digital employment.


Pillars Objectives 
- Promotion of indigenous content
- Increasing public and private sectors’ patronage of indigenous digital technology and business
- Support for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
- Ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines for the Nigerian Content
